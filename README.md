These stocks are selected because they combine strong revenue growth and healthy free-cash-flow margins, producing a Rule-of-40 score above 40%. The model excludes sectors where the metric is unreliable and penalizes low-confidence data, so the list concentrates on large, liquid growth leaders with scalable business models and improving cash generation rather than cyclical or capital-intensive firms.
