This model is for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Results are based on historical and third-party data that may be incomplete or inaccurate. Past performance does not guarantee future results. All investments involve risk, including loss of principal.
These stocks are selected because they combine strong revenue growth and healthy free-cash-flow margins, producing a Rule-of-40 score above 40%. The model excludes sectors where the metric is unreliable and penalizes low-confidence data, so the list concentrates on large, liquid growth leaders with scalable business models and improving cash generation rather than cyclical or capital-intensive firms.
